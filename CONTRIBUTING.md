## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/Exercise/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.


If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:


- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/Exercise/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.


We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.
## Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/Exerciseissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/Exercise/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->
## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Exercise, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation]() carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/Exercise/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/Exercise/issues), or you may comment in the [Discussions](https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/Exercise/discussions/1).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Exercise users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

## 您的首次代码投稿
<!--**@开发组同学们**：
我们非常欢迎大家写脚本（ Python/C++/Javascript/VBS...）来预处理 `data/string.txt` 和 `data/graph.txt`，并生成一个 .json 文件（比如说 config.json）来供后面 Rust 主程序调用。-->

### config.json
我们使用 `config.json` 用于游戏初始化配置：
> 不懂的童鞋们可以看看 [json.org](https://www.json.org/json-zh.html)，学习一下 json 的相关语法。

本项目中，我们用 `/data/src/gen.cpp` 生成一个如下格式的 config.json 配置文件。
```json
{ // json 文件框架
    "idx": [ // Index: Vec<Node>，是储存节点信息的数据结构
        {
            "tp": "Random", // 表示是一个随机跳边的节点
            "zh": "出门", // 对应 `/data/string.txt` 中的节点内容
            "num": 1, // num 表示节点的编号（编号 = 对应行号）
            "ch": [ // 表示有哪些子节点
                {
                    "att": [ // attributes，表示边的属性
                        2, // 表示连向节点 2
                        1 // 表示有 1 份的概率选中这条边
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "att": [
                        3,
                        4
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "att": [
                        4,
                        3
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "tp": "Ending", // 表示是一种结局
            "zh": "坐飞机",
            "num": 2,
            "ch": [] // 结局当然没有子节点啦
        }
    ]
}
```

## Your First Content Contribution

### 设计剧情
We place strings in the game in `/data` file. `/data/string.txt` is only for the sentences and words, and `/data/graph.txt` is only for the logic between the contents.

Here is an example graph:

![example_graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81886982/198510011-8550b2d0-ba15-468c-a800-db34a189537a.png)

#### string.txt
https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/exercise/blob/e7859c8970a6149890d3f031eb1c695ded3dac06/data/string.txt#L1-L7

We use `|`(ASCII 0x7C) to separate Chinese and English contents.

Each line corresponds to the node number is its line number, which means the example content above is the content of node 1 (Because it is at Line 1).
#### graph.txt
https://github.com/Amazingkenneth/exercise/blob/786153ac74977433781a351004fa311c541544c8/data/graph.txt#L1-L7

The graph follows this format:
```txt
x,y p
x,y
```
- when the line is in format of "x,y p", it means node `x` has a edge to `y` with a weight of probability of `p`.
- when the line is in format of "x,y", it means node `x` is a question with possible answer for user of node `y`.
### 设计地图
你可以为我们设计一个游戏地图，按照如下格式：
#### 首选项
要求包含以下几个配置
- size
  要求是矩形，给出长和宽，以 `axb` 的形式，如 `128x128`，`720x480`
- 选项别名

#### 方格种类
- aid
  急救箱，可增加血量
- box
  宝箱，有不定惊喜
- clearing
  空地，可以自由通行
- gateway
  传送门
- mud
  泥潭
- obstacle
  障碍物
- river
  河流，单行道
